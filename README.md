# Cracking the Tech Career

This file lists the ideas in the book that were new to me in one or many ways. This is in no way a summary of the book, it's more like my own scratchpad.

The ideas jotted in this file relate to my current situation and my life circumstances. At the time of scribbling these notes: 

"I am a data scientist with almost three years of experience. I work at a large company in France. The reason I'm reading this book is that I don't have a crystal clear idea about how I'd like to orient my career from this point onward..."

## Chapter 2: Advanced positioning and preparation

**Work experience**: It doesn't matter how happy you are in your current job, one day you what you're doing now will as a stepping stone for a new position and you'll have to **mash all these years work into a tiny five bullet points**. **Plan what you'd like to put in these bullet points**, don't think about it while looking for your new job, it's a bit late then!

## Chapter 3: Getting in the Door

Online applications are usually black holes. Reach out to people online or in real life, have referrals and network on daily basis, not just when you need to find a contact (by this time, it's already too late)

## Chapter 4: Resumes

The path of least resistance for the recruiter is always to **toss the resume**!
